# MergeStat Runner

[MergeStat](https://www.mergestat.com/) enables SQL queries for data in git repositories (and related sources, such as the GitHub API). It allows you to ask questions about the history and contents of your source code.

The runner is the thingy thing on the backend that does the stuff that powers all the things.
